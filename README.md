This project is made with help of Eric Matthes's book 'Python Crash Course', 2nd edition.

To play you must get all the .py files to one folder, and all the images to the folder named 'Images' inside of the first folder. Then start
executing alien_invasion.py

In this game you will destroy aliens with your ship. You have three lives, that are shown in the left corner. The points, you have earned,
and the level where you have achieved are shown on the left corner. The high score is at the top of your screen.

Controls:

[Q] - quit the game;
[P] - play (the same as a click on the green button);
[LEFT ARROW] - move left;
[RIGHT ARROW] - move right;
[SPACE] - shoot;

The speed of the game will increase, including speed of your ship, alien ships, bullets and the cost of destroying enemies.

Try to get the highest score!
